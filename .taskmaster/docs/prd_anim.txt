There is an animation issue. When recreating the nodes, check to see if the user's mouse is hovering over the node, and if so, 
recreate it with the fully-expanded status button.

Summary of recent changes:

  1. Track Status Changes in Pending Operations (Canvas.tsx:496-501)

  Added status tracking to pendingOperationsRef when an optimistic update happens, just like we do for position, text, and description
  changes:
  pendingOperationsRef.current.set(nodeId, {
      type: "status",
      data: { status: newStatus },
      timestamp: Date.now(),
  });

  2. Updated Type Definition (Canvas.tsx:109)

  Extended the pendingOperationsRef type to include status in the data field:
  data: { x?: number; y?: number; text?: string; description?: string; status?: string }

  3. Added Status Conflict Detection (Canvas.tsx:574)

  Extended the conflict detection logic to check for status mismatches:
  (pendingOp.type === "status" && convexNode.status !== pendingOp.data.status)

  4. Added Cleanup on Error (Canvas.tsx:512-513)

  Ensured pending status operations are cleaned up if the mutation fails.

  How It Works Now

  Before (Buggy Flow):
  1. User clicks status → Optimistic update → CustomNode renders with new status ✓
  2. Convex syncs back → ALL nodes recreated → CustomNode unmounts/remounts ✗
  3. isHoveringNode resets to false → Button snaps to small size ✗
  4. onMouseEnter fires → Button animates to large size (visible flicker) ✗

  After (Fixed Flow):
  1. User clicks status → Optimistic update → CustomNode renders with new status ✓
  2. Pending operation tracked → Convex sync detects matching status ✓
  3. Operation removed from pending → No conflict, no unnecessary node recreation ✓
  4. isHoveringNode state preserved → No flicker ✓

  Testing

  1. Start the dev server: npm run dev
  2. Create a node and hover over it (status button should expand)
  3. Click the status button to cycle through statuses
  4. Expected: Status changes instantly with no flicker or snap-to-small animation
  5. Previous bug: Button would snap small then animate to full size

  The fix follows the same pattern already established for other optimistic updates (position/text/description) and maintains proper
  error handling with rollback on failures.
