# How to Start the Workflow Canvas App

## Quick Start (Most Common)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser to: **http://localhost:3000**

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### If you see "EADDRINUSE: address already in use"

This means port 3000 is already occupied. Kill the process:

```bash
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
npm run dev
```

### If you see 404 errors or the app doesn't load properly

Clear the Next.js cache and rebuild:

```bash
# Stop any running processes
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Clear the cache
rm -rf .next

# Rebuild
npm run build

# Start fresh
npm run dev
```

### Full Reset (Nuclear Option)

If nothing else works, do a complete clean start:

```bash
# 1. Stop all processes
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# 2. Clear all caches and dependencies
rm -rf .next node_modules package-lock.json

# 3. Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# 4. Build the app
npm run build

# 5. Start the dev server
npm run dev
```
